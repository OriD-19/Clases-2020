## Rules

For **gradable adjectives**, we can modify them with special words like *very, too, more, etc.* This is because the meaning of the adjective is not in it's **most meaningful form**.

For **ungradable adjectives,** we can modify them with *adverbs,* such as *totally, absolutely, etc.* This is because there's no way of expressing the idea of an ungradable adjective as another word with the similar meaning (for example, we cannot say "very impossible", because there's no such thing as "more than impossible").

## Exercise page 22 - match the adjectives

| Gradable    | Ungradable  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Angry       | Furious     |
| Clever      | Brilliant   |
| Funny       | Hilarious   |
| Interesting | Fascinating |
| Pleased     | Delighted   |
| Sad         | Heartbroken |
| Scared      | Terrified   |
| Surprising  | Amazing     | 

## Exercise 12, page 23 - Complete with the adjectives

1. We were very *pleased* to get tickets for the first night of the Harry Potter play!
2. I find the historical novels absolutely *fascinating*. History is one of my main interests.
3. His new comedy is very *funny* but not as good as his last one.
4. Sara was completely *heartbroken* when her favorite actor said he was retiring.
