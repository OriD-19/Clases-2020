## First conditional
Used for expressing a possibility for an action **in the future**.
If clause: Simple present.
Result clause: Simple future.

## Second conditional
Used for expressing a possibility for an action that is **hypotethical**. It's not a real situation, but we act as if it was.

If clause: Simple past.
Result clause: Would + infinitive

## Third conditional
Situations that are really difficult to change, and **ocurred in the past**.

If clause: past perfect.
Result clause: "Would have" + past participle.

## Combination (Second and third conditional)

For example:

> If I **had eaten** lunch, I **wouldn't feel** sick.

You can change your reality, but you can't revert your past actions.

> If my computer hadn't crashed, I would be playing my favorite videogame.
